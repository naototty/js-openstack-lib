JS-OpenStack-lib
================

JS-OpenStack-lib is a Javascript library for interacting with OpenStack clouds. The project aims to provide a consistent and complete set of interactions with OpenStack's many services, along with documentations, examples, and tools.
This library is compatible with both browser and server side Javascript.

Example
-------

The following example simply connects to an OpenStack cloud and list flavors in the Compute service:

::

   import OpenStack from 'js-openstack-lib';

   // Initialize cloud
   // cloudConfig is a JSON object corresponding to clouds.yaml
   // (It is your responsibility to load and parse it)
   const openStack = new OpenStack({
     region_name: 'Region1',
     auth: {
       username: 'user',
       password: 'pass',
       project_name: 'js-openstack-lib',
       auth_url: 'http://192.168.99.99/'
     }
   });
   // List all flavors
   openStack.networkList()
     .then((networks) => {
       console.log(networks);
     });
